Killings by persons who were insane, deranged or temporarily incapacitated mentally occur throughout this data set. The standard for proving insanity was the McNaghten test, the standard being that the actor did not know what he was doing or did not know that it was wrong.

The killing of Lazarus Averbuch by Chief of Police George Shippy in 1908 brought together as victim and defendant a poor Russian Jewish immigrant, suspected of being an anarchist, and a Chief of Police with little patience for any radical political agitation, of the kind associated with anarchists. Mysteries remain as to the identity and allegiances of the victim, why he had come to the residence of the Chief of Police, and the motivation of the Police Chief and the credibility of his explanations for the killing of Averbuch.</description>

Murders by police and of police officers constitute a significant percentage of the homicides in this data set. Police kill persons who flee or resist arrest, or in circumstances of civil disorder, in self defense, or in other situations. These cases have been separately identified, and much research remains to be done on this subject.

Homicide researchers have long been interested in the connection between homicides, both accidental and intentional, and the use of alcohol, and the cases in this data set provide an opportunity to analyze the relationship between alcohol and homicide with a new empirical data.</description>

The gangland murder of this seemingly blameless Assistant Stateâ€™s Attorney outraged the public and generated criticism of law enforcement and the notorious gangs fighting in the Beer Wars (Illinois Crime Survey p.825-841). The case signified to the public and the press the inability of the courts and prosecutors to control the violence generated by organized crime, as rival factions sought to control the illegal supply of alcohol and other activities.</description>
