      <description>A view across the main basin from the east front of Machinery Hall, near the Obelisk. The western faï¿½ade of the Agriculture Building with its wealth of statuary forms a rich background. In the distance, the great Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building reared its great height. To the left, a detail of the east entrance to Machinery Hall is in sight. Gondolas skimmed the waters of the lagoon.
