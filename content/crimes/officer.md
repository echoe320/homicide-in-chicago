Murders by police and of police officers constitute a significant percentage of the homicides in this data set. Police kill persons who flee or resist arrest, or in circumstances of civil disorder, in self defense, or in other situations. These cases have been separately identified, and much research remains to be done on this subject.

[The police](/legal/cpd/), as the record keepers of this data set, are a topic of great interest. The police should be the most accurate record keepers of statistics and information concerning deaths caused by police and the killings of police ([JCLC p.527-529](/docs_fk/homicide/jclc527-529.pdf), [JCLC p.549-550](/docs_fk/homicide/jclc549-550.pdf)).
