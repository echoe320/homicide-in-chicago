Deaths attributed to accidental shootings occur regularly throughout this set of cases. Some cases involve children, some involve quarrels in saloons or bars, or circumstances of domestic violence.

Gun accidents and gun deaths are typically recorded by the police as part of their regular record keeping ([JCLC p.547-548](/docs_fk/homicide/jclc547-548.pdf), [JCLC p.516](/docs_fk/homicide/jclc516.pdf)).  Records concerning the regulation of firearms during this period are contradictory, and the subject of academic research and debate ([Article by Greg S. Weaver](/docs_fk/homicide/jclc823-833.pdf)).
