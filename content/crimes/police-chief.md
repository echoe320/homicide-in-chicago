Extraordinary and dramatic circumstances of homicide, such as these, offer an opportunity for investigation into original source materials. Did the newspapers of the day offer an explanation for these events? Was the homicide sparked by police corruption, or related to another incident of interracial conflict?

Who was George Ahoy, the Chief of Police? And where is Margan Park, or is it Morgan Park? This illustrates the ‘errors’ and contradictions in these records which were purposely not ‘corrected’ during the transposition of the handwritten records. Is there a record of the proceedings before the coroner’s jury, either in the coroner’s files or in a newspaper report published after the coroner’s jury? Wiley was sentenced to hang on March 25, 1904. Was there a report of that judgment? Did he actually [hang](/legal/capital/)? Was there an appeal? Does the Illinois Supreme Court have any records of this case? What about Mrs. Harriet Payne, guilty of manslaughter? Who was she and what was her role?

The contemporaneous newspapers would be the first place to start, beginning with the days after the crime. There might be an obituary of George Ahoy in one of the English language papers. The Chicago Tribune, as well as a number of other English language papers would have been published during this period.

In addition to the many English language papers published in Chicago, there were some 80 foreign language papers published in Chicago during this period, and they were said to reach an audience of more than 1 million readers.

Both the Illinois State Archives, and the Cook County Coroner’s records might have additional information about this case.
