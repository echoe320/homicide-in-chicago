###Accidents
![1928]()

Deaths attributed to accidental shooting occur regularly throughout this set of cases. Some cases involve children, some involve quarrels in saloons or bars, or circumstances of domestic violence. 

Gun accidents and gun deaths are typically recorded by the police as part of their regular record keeping ([JCLC p.547-548](doesn't work), [JCLC p.516](doesn't work)). Records concerning the regulation of firearms during this period are contradictory, and the subject of academic research and debate ([Article by Greg S. Weaver](doesnt work)). 

In the 19th century many people are killed in horse-related accidents, but as the 20th century progresses, everyone is killed by recklessly driven automobiles. If there is one technological change which overwhelmingly changes the character of peopleâ€™s lives before the computer, it is the automobile.
