###Labor Laws

Please visit our companion site – [The Life & Times of Florence Kelley in Chicago 1891-1899](http://florencekelley.northwestern.edu/) - which focuses on the work of Florence Kelley, the first woman factory inspector in the United States, and appointed in Illinois by Governor John Peter Altgeld in 1893. A resident of Hull House, and a reformer – who refused to be associated with any political party–Florence Kelley lived in Chicago from 1891 until 1899, leading and participating in a variety of projects. These included: a wage and ethnicity census of the slums and tenements in Chicago; the reporting of cases and contagion in the smallpox epidemic of 1893; the enforcement of the universal primary education laws, and, most importantly, enforcing the provisions of the Illinois Factory Inspections Law of 1893. The website includes an [archive](http://florencekelley.northwestern.edu/archives/) containing nearly 50,000 pages of scanned documents.
