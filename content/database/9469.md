CaseDescription: Derocco, Frank � Age 24 � Fatally shot at 10:10 PM, 4/6/30, at 18
  N. Curtis St., a sporting house, which he and two other men attempted to stick-up,
  by the keeper, Emily Novak, alias Marshall. This apparently is the true version
  of the case despite the fact that the woman, who at first identified him, later
  refused to do so, and that his own store was that he was shot in the vicinity of
  Armour & Austin Aves., which was disproved. Emily Novak and Hubert Novak were booked
  for manslaughter on 4/17/30. They were exonerated by the Coroner 4/18/30 whose verdict
  was that deceased was shot by unknown persons to be arrested for murder. On 4/21/30
  leave to file complaints against the Novaks was denied by Judge Sborboro. 26 Dist.
