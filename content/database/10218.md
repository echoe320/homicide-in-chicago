CaseDescription: Mulcahy, Chas. J. - Age 45 - Deceased and Barney Ruberry, both business
  agents of the Plumber�s Union, were fatally shot at 3:35 PM, 8/20/30, at the S.W.
  corner of Addison St. and Western Ave., where the new Lane Tech. High School is
  under construction, by �some unknown person or persons� who fired at them thru a
  window as they approached a construction shanty. Two men were observed escaping
  in an auto belonging to the John Carl Stein Co., Plumbing Contractors, who had had
  trouble with the union. On 8/27/30 Charles Stein and Albert Courchene, of that concern,
  were surrendered by their attorney at the DB. On advice of counsel they refused
  to make a statement there as well as at the inquest, but it was intimated they would
  claim self-defense if brought to trial. Failure of identification brought them release
  at the inquest on 8/28/30 and for the same reason the case was nolle prossed 10/23/30
  by Judge Lyle. 39 Dist.
