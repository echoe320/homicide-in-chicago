Judge Michael L. McKinley standing with a baseball bat on a street	Judge M. L. McKinley, a former Chief Justice of the Criminal Court of Cook County, wrote __Crime and the Civic Cancer__ â€“ Graft, an expose of graft and corruption in the courts in 1923. As a former Chief Judge of the Criminal Court he could describe in detail just how the process of corrupting judges and prosecutors worked. The expose was published as a series of articles in the Chicago Daily News in 1923. Periodically during this period newspapers would expose public corruption and the fallibility of government, a role which continues into the present day. The series of articles in the Chicago Daily News was subsequently issued as a pamphlet and is reproduced here in its entirety. It is one of the most detailed accounts of judicial and police corruption ever published.
