### Archives, Court Records and Sources of Original Documents

*Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts*, “A Short History of the Illinois Judicial Systems,” [Administrative Office of Illinois Courts, 1968, reprinted, 1990] Ch. V describes the structure of the Illinois courts under the constitution of 1870, including several illustrative graphs showing lines of appellate authority. As a spur to the Judicial Article of 1964, which was the first system wide reform after 1870, the Cook County criminal justice system was described as follows:

>“In 1962, Cook County had 208 courts; the Circuit Court, the Superior Court, the Family Court, Criminal Court, Probate Court, County Court, Municipal Court of Chicago, 23 city, village, town and municipal courts, 75 Justice of the Peace Courts, and 103 police magistrate courts. Many of those courts had overlapping jurisdiction which increased the already great organizational problems. Perhaps more serious was the fact that there was no administrative authority to unify, co-ordinate and supervise them.” (P. 19)

Juvenile Cases, 1899 –1926 (with gaps), *Cook County Circuit Court Archives*, Richard J. Daley Center, Chicago, Illinois. There are approximately 2,700 extant case files from the court’s founding in 1899 until 1926, but it is not known why these select records were preserved. Every child who entered the juvenile court system was assigned a permanent case number and all his or her subsequent legal papers were filed under this number. The case files are closed and researchers must receive written permission from the presiding Chief Judge of the Cook County Juvenile Court in order to use them.

Solenberger, Alice Willard. *One Thousand Homeless Men – A Study of Original Records*. New York: New York Survey Associates, Russell Sage Foundation, 1911. This book includes narratives of interviews and statistics. Its subject is ‘those men of the homeless class who lived in cheap lodging houses in the loop who were applicants for public aid during the years 1900-1903.’ [Introductory, p. 3-4.]

The classification of subjects into four groups illustrates contemporary attitudes and economic realities: The study groups these men into these classes: self-supporting; temporarily dependent [runaway boys; strangers who lack city references, men who have been robbed, victims of accidents or illness; the addicted, misfits, etc.]; chronically dependent,[the crippled, deformed, aged, feeble-minded, insane...]; parasitic, [confirmed wanderers or tramps, criminals, impostors...] Introductory, p.10.

>“All large cities and some small ones in these days have cheap lodging houses in which men may secure a night’s lodging at a cost from ten to twenty-five cents. With the exception of Greater New York, the city of Chicago has a greater number of such houses than any other city in the United States.... In normal times men of this class who come to Chicago need not long remain unemployed if they wish work. One season trade may soon by fitted into another. The period between the closing of navigation in the autumn and the beginning of work in the lumber camps is not long. In February the ice-cutting season opens and this furnishes employment to thousands of men at a time of year when in many other cities work for unskilled laborers is especially scarce.... During the course of the ordinary winter there are numerous heavy snowfalls, and the removal of snow from downtown streets affords temporary employment for hundreds.” Introductory, p. 6-8.

1911- present: Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology, subsequently the Journal of Criminal Law Criminology and Police Science, and now the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, began publication in 1911 and contains many articles on crime, criminal law, police administration and criminal justice issues.

### Contemporaneous Accounts and Early Academic Studies

Stead, William T. [If Christ Came to Chicago -A Plea for the Union of All Who Love in the Service of All Who Suffer](/pubs/ICCTC/). Original publication, Laird and Lee, Publishers, Chicago 1894, reprinted Chicago Historical Bookworks, Evanston, Il. 1990. William T. Stead was a very well known, reform minded British minister and journalist, in the Progressive tradition, who first came to Chicago in 1893 for the World’s Columbia Exposition and then returned in the depression of 1893, and stayed to study the city, its government, its laws and their enforcement, its vice districts, its rich and its destitute. Despite his evangelical purpose, to show that if Christ came to Chicago he would find little of the Christian spirit, the book is neither preachy nor highly rhetorical. Stead’s descriptions of places, and transcriptions of meetings with real historical figures, and the poor and rich of the city in their habitats capture that world and time period. Descriptions include: the various mechanics of vote fraud and vote buying; tax dodging, corruption on the city council, police enforcement and its absence, the economics of and working conditions in the Levee district, the saloon-alderman and those political and economic incentives, and life of tramps, the imprisoned, and the abandoned. All walk through these pages, speaking with their own individual voices.

Abbott, Edith. _The Tenements of Chicago_, 1908 -1935. Chicago: U. Chicago Press, 1936.

Addams, Jane. _Twenty Years at Hull-House_. New York: Macmillan Press, 1910. The classic, first person account by the visionary leader and public figure behind Chicago’s first public welfare institution, the Settlement House.

Steffens, Lincoln. _The Shame of the Cities_ (1902-3). New York: Sagamore Press Inc. 1957. This volume reprints a series of ‘muckraking’ articles about city corruption. Chapter 5 takes Chicago as it subject. An interesting example of contemporaneous journalism, although from the present perspective the absence of sources and documentation is a serious omission. Formerly published as a series of articles in _McClure’s Magazine_ in 1902 and 1903.

Reckless, Walter C. _Vice in Chicago_. Chicago: U. Chicago Press, 1933. Beginning as a Ph. D. thesis and subsequently published in the University of Chicago Sociological Series, edited by Ellsworth Faris, Robert E. Park, and Ernest W. Burgess. This is a well written, sociological study, with extensive demographic, public health and economic data on aspects of vice in the notorious vice districts of Chicago. Topics include: the changing demographics of the business of prostitution; organized crime involvement and control of vice; exposes of government graft allowing and supporting organized crime involvement; fraudulent voting practices which perpetuated organized crime control of government offices; police protection of and involvement in the business; and the periodic enforcement by city and state officials in response to pressure from citizen’s groups. ‘Vice’ is principally prostitution, but also includes the distribution of alcohol, especially during Prohibition, and other illegal activities in the segregated districts of Chicago. The pattern was of intermittent enforcement of the laws prohibiting vice, after the dramatic closing of the vice district in 1912 in response to public outcry. A comprehensive, serious study with a wealth of demographic and court data, an exhaustive review of prior reports and commissions, including official data primarily on the post World War I period, but in some categories going back to the early part of the century.

Barnard, Harry. “_Eagle Forgotten” - The Life of John Peter Altgeld_. New York: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1938 (496 pp.). An extensive biography, with bibliography, of the Governor of Illinois and some time law partner of Clarence Darrow. His public life encompassed many historic and important episodes in the history of Chicago. His pardoning of some of the anarchists from the Haymarket trial caused a national political firestorm. The account of his itinerant childhood as a day farm laborer and his subsequent rise in politics is a rich and fulsome narrative of the life of the times. This is a political history of the city and the state, as well as a chronicle of the life of an especially interesting and atypical Governor, lawyer and public figure.

Frederick Thrasher, The Gang, Chicago. U. Chicago Press, 1927. Another in the series of University of Chicago sociological studies. The author identifies three places of gang activity: the North side ‘jungles,’the West Side ‘wilderness,’ and the South side ‘badlands.’

The social reform movements, and advocates for and against prohibition, and religious proselytizers produced a variety of hortatory literature often including statements attributed to public figures of the day. For their language, diction, and allegations of unverifiable facts, these books and pamphlets offer, if nothing else, a vernacular time capsule of public speech, and occasional glimpses into the life and conditions of the day.

Grant Eugene Stevens, Wicked City, Chicago, 1906, published by G.E. Stevens, 1906 is an example. This is an odd combination of novel, puzzle, mystery story, and commentary upon the Wicked City Redeemed, including some contemporary illustrations and photographs. The structure of the book is to collect and solicit opinions and pronouncements from a variety of public figures and fictional persons as to whether Chicago is a ‘wicked city.’ Much attention paid to drinking, gambling and the white slave trade.

Simpson, Dick. _Rogues, Rebels and Rubber Stamps – The Politics of the Chicago City Council from 1863 to the Present_. Westview Press, 2001. A colorful historical narrative of the history and politics of the Chicago City Council by a former Alderman. Ch. 2 deals with the Chicago City Council under the ‘Grey Wolves,’ from the Chicago fire to the Great Depression, approximately the period spanned by this data set. The Civil War was followed by a divisive and hotly contested party politics, and by 1865 Chicago was an industrial giant and the undisputed capital of the mid-west. “Local government from the Chicago Fire in 1871 until the Great Depression in 1929 was characterized by corruption, ‘boodle,’ and fragmented power ....The city council was at the center of a corrupt political system in which aldermen and judges could be bribed; the laws and the police favored the businessman, not the workingman; and public officials were often motivated by ambition and lust for money....The battle between machine and reform was the great civic war that replaced the partisanship of the Civil War period.” p. 464-7. The first ethnic based political machines were formed after the Chicago fire and persisted into the depression. The years between 1893 and Cermak in 1931 were ‘the most disreputable in the City’s history.’ p. 50.

The author sums up the contemporary mood of the city as follows: “The ‘apprehensive concern’ surrounding Haymarket was based in ‘the feeling and the fact that it is one phase, and the worse phase, of a widespread discontent upon the part of millions of the poorer people of this and other countries.’” p. 169. Internal citation omitted.

Smith, Carl S. _Chicago and the American Literary Imagination, 1880-1920_. Chicago: U. of Chicago Press, 1984.

U.S. Census, Negro Population in the United States, 1790-1915, Washington, Gov’t Printing Office, 1918. A special report of the U.S. Census.

Harold F. Gosnell, Negro Politicians, U. Chicago Press, originally published 1935, reprinted with a new Introduction by James Q. Wilson, 1967. Chronicles the activities of Negroes in politics and the society in Chicago, where Negroes first entered northern politics in significant numbers although Negroes constituted only 7 per cent of the Chicago population in 1930. “Gosnell said the purpose of his book was to ‘describe in realistic fashion the struggle of a minority group to advance its status by political methods.’ Although it lacks any explicit theoretical orientation and offers few large generalizations, his study succeeds in presenting a vivid and well-documented account of that struggle for status. Today the methods and the motives of Negro leaders have changed somewhat, but the problems and frustrations remain essentially the same.” 1967 Introduction, p. xii. For its relevance to this Project, see Ch. XII, Negro Police Officers, p.244-279.

Spear, Allan H. _Black Chicago: The Making of a Negro Ghetto, 1890-1920_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967. Emphasizing economic, demographic, and institutional conditions, Black Chicago chronicles the development of the city’s black community:

>“The story of Chicago’s Negroes in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is interwoven with the general history of the City.... The profound changes that took place in the Chicago Negro community between the 1890's and 1920 had both internal and external dimensions. One the one hand, they were the result of mounting hostility of white Chicagoans. Whites grew anxious as a growing Negro population sought more and better housing; they feared job competition in an era of industrial strife when employers frequently used Negroes as strikebreakers; and they viewed Negroes as pawns of a corrupt political machine.... The rise of Chicago’s black ghetto belongs to both urban history and Negro history...” Introduction p. 7-8. “Chicago had in its midst a sharply delineated Negro ghetto, separated from the white community by a high though unofficial wall of segregation and discrimination. Within this wall, a quarter of a million black Chicagoans maintained a community life that, on the surface at least, seemed virtually independent of white Chicago.... This study documents the formation of a northern Negro ghetto. It examines the forces, both external and internal, that conditioned the development of separate Negro community life and it analyzes the impact of this development upon Negro racial ideology, the growth of Negro race consciousness, and the composition and outlook of the Negro leadership class. It confronts these problems by tracing the history of the Chicago Negro community in the generation prior to the great riot of 1919....” Preface, p. vii-ix.
