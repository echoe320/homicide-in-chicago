In the order of their sequence may be seen the old Leland Hotel, the famous hotel Richelieu, the Masury Building, the Hotel Victoria, the Art Institute, later occupied by the Chicago Club, and the Studebaker Building, afterwards known as the Fine Arts Building. The Auditorium, the Congress Hotel, and the Illinois Central Station at Park Row were not in existence at this time. Hansom cabs and horse drawn vehicles only were in evidence.
