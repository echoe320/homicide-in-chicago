Rush Street Bridge in 1890, said to have been the busiest bridge in the world. The William M. Hoyt Building, on the site of Fort Dearborn, is at the left. At the right on the south side of the river are the Goodrich Docks with the Lake Michigan and Lake Superior Transportation Company on the north side. Spaulding & Merrick Tobacco Company is at the north end of the bridge. The spire of the Holy Name Cathedral may be seen in the distance.
