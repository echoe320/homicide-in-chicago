Interior view of a room in Chicago in which three men are standing around a high table that has pieces of fabric on it. One of the men is wearing work clothes and the other two are wearing suits. One of the men wearing a suit is leaning over the table, writing. Two girls are sitting on opposite sides of a lower table and are sewing by hand. A stove and pipe are visible to the side of the activity in the room.
