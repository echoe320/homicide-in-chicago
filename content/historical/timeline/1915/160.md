Half-length portrait of Florence Carsello, a bombing victim, sitting on the knee of Martin Ernest, policeman from the Maxwell Street Station. An unidentified boy is sitting in the background. Florence's family was the target of a bomb explosion in their home at 846 South Miller Street in the Near West Side community area of Chicago, Illinois. Florence had been buried under the debris, but was rescued by police detectives. The rest of the family also survived with minimum injuries.
