Image of a shoeless boy, holding the hand of a bigger girl and standing on the sidewalk of Cleveland Avenue (formerly Milton Avenue) in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois. This street was one of four, including West Chicago, Cambridge Avenue, and West Oak Street that were the boundaries of one of Chicago's most overpopulated areas.
