View of Chicago Cubs and opposing team on the field during a game at West Side Grounds. A batter is running toward first base, while another player is advancing to third base. Pitcher is facing first base. West Side Grounds was located between West Polk Street, South Wolcott Avenue (formerly Lincoln Street), West Taylor Street, and South Wood Street, in the Near West Side community area of Chicago, Illinois. This is a view from above home plate. Spectators sitting in the outfield bleachers, billboards on the outfield fence and buildings beyond the ballpark are visible in the background. Among the billboards are advertisements for The Chicago Daily News and The Fair, a clothing store.
